## Navigation Structure

The navigation between the screens is handled by `@react-navigation/native` and `@react-navigation/stack`.

### Stack Navigator

The `Stack.Navigator` includes the following routes:

- `Welcome`
- `Verifykey`
- `Home`
- `Addselection`
- `AddNewmember`
- `AddExistingmember`
- `Viewbydate`
- `ViewbyName`
- `EditProfile`

The initial route is `Welcome`. All screens have headers hidden by default.

## Key Components

- **CustomText**: A reusable component for rendering text with consistent styles.
- **DateTimePicker**: Used in `AddExistingmember` for selecting transaction dates.
- **AsyncStorage**: Handles local storage of session and username data.
- **Fetch API**: Communicates with the backend for data retrieval and updates.

## Backend Integration

The app interacts with a REST API hosted at `https://my-money-mate-server.vercel.app`. Key endpoints include:

- `/get-all-names`: Fetches a list of all member names.
- `/add-transaction`: Adds a new transaction for a member.
- `/create-member`: Creates a new member profile.
- `/all-transactions-date`: Retrieves transactions grouped by date.
- `/get-all-transactions`: Retrieves transactions grouped by individual.
- `/edit-profile`: Updates user profile details.
- `/verify-user`: Verifies login credentials.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   expo start
   ```
4. Ensure the backend server is running at the specified endpoint.
